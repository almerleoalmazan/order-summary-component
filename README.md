## My process

I always start with the mobile-first approach, as I know this is the best practice, and others do as well.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

### Continued development

I'm planning to continue working on newbie challenges because I'm not comfortable enough with what I've learned in CSS and responsive design. I'm also looking forward to learning SASS, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and ReactJS.
